    Scenario: Displaying licenses from another inventory pool in closed contracts
      Given there exists a closed contract with a license, for which an other inventory pool is responsible and owner
      When I search globally after this license with its inventory code
      Then all matching software licenses appear
      And the licenses container shows the license line with the following information:
      | Inventory Code             |
      | Software name              |
      | Responsible inventory pool |
      And I don't see the button group on the license line
      And I click on the list of licenses on the contract line
      Then I see in the tooltip the software name of this license

  Scenario: Finding contracts for software by searching for a borrower
    Given a software license exists
    And this software license is handed over to a normal user
    When I search after the name of that person
    Then the contract of this person appears in the search results
    And this person appears in the search results

  Scenario: How search results are displayed
    Given a software product exists
    And there exist licenses for this software product
    When I see these in my search result
    Then I can select to list only software products
    And I can select to list only software licenses
